Use0MK is a Ruby interface for the {http://0.mk} URL shortening service. It uses standard Ruby conventions in exposing 0.mk's API and allows developers to more easily utilize 0.mk.

== Installation

Use0MK requires the +json+ gem in order to work properly.

Use0MK as a gem is hosted on {http://gemcutter.org}. After adding gemcutter to your gem sources, install it with:

  gem install use0mk

== Examples

=== Shortening a URL

  require "use0mk"

  # Pass your username as the first argument and your API key as
  # the second. You can safely use this without them.
  zeromk = Use0MK::Interface.new

  # It is probably a good idea to watch for exceptions when
  # calling any method on Use0MK::Interface or Use0MK::ShortenedURI
  # in order to check if something went wrong. Watch for the exceptions
  # thrown by URI.parse, Net::HTTP errors and the Use0MK errors.
  short = zeromk.shorten("http://google.com")

  puts "Shortened #{short.title}[#{short.long_uri}] to #{short.short_uri},"
  puts "with #{short.short_name}. Use #{short.delete_uri} with this"
  puts "delete code #{short.delete_code} to delete this shortened URL."
  puts "You can view the stats on this shortened URL by following"
  puts "#{short.stats_uri}, too."

  puts

  puts "Too late, now your shortened URL has been deleted.\n" if short.delete


=== Previewing a URL

  require "use0mk"

  zeromk = Use0MK::Interface.new # username, API key

  # It's a good idea to watch for URI, Net::HTTP and Use0MK errors here.
  # Pass a hash of :uri, or :short_name to preview in order to have it
  # work out for you.
  preview = zeromk.preview :uri => "http://0.mk/use0mk.rb"

  deletable = preview.delete

  puts "The #{preview.short_uri} links to #{preview.long_uri}."
  puts "Too bad, tho, it was created by #{preview.origin}ing a"
  puts "given URL/shortname. Now you #{deletable ? 'can' : 'cannot'}"
  puts "delete the short URL. #{deletable ? ':)' : ':(' }"

  puts
